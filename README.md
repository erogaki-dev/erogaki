# Erogaki

Erogaki is a collection of projects to make decensoring censored Hentai easy.

It consists of the following repositories:

- [erogaki-discord](https://github.com/erogaki-dev/erogaki-discord) (A [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot, which takes censored Hentai and returns a decensored version.)
- [erogaki-mask](https://github.com/erogaki-dev/erogaki-mask) (A component to handle detection and masking of censored regions.)
- [DeepCreamPy-erogaki-wrapper](https://github.com/erogaki-dev/DeepCreamPy-erogaki-wrapper) (Our wrapper for [DeepCreamPy](https://github.com/erogaki-dev/DeepCreamPy), so it works with other erogaki components.)
- [erogaki-wrapper-shared-python](https://github.com/erogaki-dev/erogaki-wrapper-shared-python) (Shared Python code for erogaki-wrappers written in Python.)
